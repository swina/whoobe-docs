# Workflow

**Whoobe** has been designed to simplify the process to create and maintain multiple web sites with a single installation.

The concept is to deploy a **full static serverless website**. 

By the way Whoobe can work with 3 different scenario:

| Application               | Environment   | Notes
| :---                      | :---          | :---          
| **Whoobe Generator**      | local         | Generate locally / Deploy **./dist** folder
|                           | cloud         | Generate in the cloud
| **Whoobe Studio**         | local         | 
|                           | cloud         | Build and run in the cloud if you need different users working on the same application
| **Whoobe Server**         | local         | all data are saved locally 
|                           | cloud         | data in the cloud no build is required. Nodejs is required
